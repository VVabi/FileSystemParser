# FileSystemParser

A toy project of mine to learn some C#. Should work out of the box in visual studio.

Can parse a file system, starting in the path given as first cmd line argument. It will print all folders and files it finds, together with their size. 
You can specify printing depth via second cmd line argument.

TODOS:
- add better description
- temporal component: Add capability to track changes in the filesystem (to eg quickly find logging files getting out of hand or similar)
